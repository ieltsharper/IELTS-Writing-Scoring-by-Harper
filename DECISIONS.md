# Decisions

Defaults chosen where the spec was ambiguous, and every addition or substitution, with the reason.
No service in the spec was replaced; everything runs on GitHub Pages, Apps Script, Sheets, Drive and Gmail.

## Tooling and structure

- **Single npm package at the repo root.** Front end, Apps Script back end, mock API and tests share one
  `package.json`, so the pure logic in `shared/` (band rounding, word count, Claude parsing, statistics) is used by both
  sides without duplication.
- **Back end written in TypeScript and bundled with esbuild.** Apps Script has no module system, so
  `apps-script/build.mjs` bundles `apps-script/src/gas.ts` into one `dist/Code.js` (IIFE) and appends the top-level
  functions Apps Script needs (`doPost`, `doGet`, `setup`, `installTriggers`, `dailyJob`, `hourlyJob`). `clasp` pushes
  `apps-script/dist` (`rootDir: dist`). esbuild targets ES2020 for the Apps Script V8 runtime.
- **Google services are passed in as narrow interfaces** (`apps-script/src/services.ts`). `gas.ts` wires the real
  `SpreadsheetApp`/`DriveApp`/`DocumentApp`/`GmailApp`/`MailApp`/`CacheService`/`LockService`; tests and the mock API use
  in-memory versions (`apps-script/testing/memory.ts`). The in-memory Sheet mimics the two Sheets behaviours that matter:
  a leading `=` becomes a formula and a leading apostrophe is hidden.
- **The mock API runs the real back-end code** (`mock-server/server.ts`) with in-memory services, so it follows exactly
  the same contract as the web app. Test-only helpers live under `/__test/` and exist only in the mock.
- **Extra test:** `tests/unit/gasBundle.test.ts` loads the built `Code.js` with fake Google globals to exercise the
  adapter code in `gas.ts` (signed-byte SHA-256, base64, Drive moves, triggers) that otherwise only runs in Google.
- **Extra test:** an axe-core accessibility scan (`tests/e2e/a11y.spec.ts`) runs with the Playwright flow.
- **`.clasp.json` is not committed** (it holds the admin's script ID); `.clasp.json.example` is.
- **Front-end config** is `VITE_API_URL` in `.env.production`. The web app URL is public by design.
- **Hash routing** (`#/essays/…`) so GitHub Pages needs no 404 tricks; `base: './'` so the build works under `/<repo>/`.
- **Vanilla TypeScript UI** (a tiny `h()` DOM builder) instead of a framework: small bundle, and text is always inserted
  as text nodes, which makes XSS mistakes hard to write. ESLint forbids `innerHTML`.

## Data model additions

- **`Essays.test_date`** column added: the spec's submit form has an optional test date but the Essays table had no
  column for it.
- **Every cell is stored as plain text** (`setup()` sets the `@` number format on every tab), so Sheets never turns ISO
  dates or numbers into other types. Booleans are `true`/`false`, numbers are decimal strings.
- **Assignments `class_ids` / `student_ids`** are JSON arrays in one cell.
- **"Other" topic** is seeded with the 15 topics and is never counted as a gap on the topics page.
- **Scores are one row per essay** (no history). Each source's scores (including Claude's first draft) are kept in
  SourceFeedback, which is what calibration uses.
- **Cell size:** Sheets cells hold 50,000 characters. Pasted replies/tool output are limited to 20,000 characters, essays
  to 20,000, feedback is checked in total, and the Sheet layer refuses longer values instead of failing silently.

## Roles and access

- **Admin = email in `ADMIN_EMAIL`** (comma-separated list allowed). The role is recomputed from the property on every
  request; the Users `role` column is informational and synced by `setup()`.
- **`authorize(action, user, resource)` is called twice per request**: once by the router at action level, and again by
  handlers with the loaded resource (essay, score, draft, …). Unknown actions are denied to students.
- **The admin cannot delete their own account from the app** (it would lock them out); students can.
- **Students see results only for scored essays.** Saving a draft score moves the essay to `in_review` but shows
  nothing to the student. Once scored, an essay can only be updated with **Submit score** (not "Save draft"), so a
  student never sees half-edited scores.

## Security

- **CSRF does not apply**: there are no cookies. The session token is kept in `localStorage` and sent in the JSON body
  of every request; a page on another site cannot read it or make the browser attach it.
- **Tokens:** login token = two UUIDs (hyphens removed, 64 hex chars), valid 15 minutes, single use; session token the
  same shape, valid 30 days. Only SHA-256 hashes are stored. The login link is removed from the address bar and history
  as soon as the page loads, and `<meta name="referrer" content="no-referrer">` keeps it out of referrers.
- **Rate limits** (CacheService, fixed one-hour windows): 3 login links per email, 30 overall, and 30 new sign-ups per
  hour. Every login/sign-up request gets the same "If that email is registered…" message.
- **Content-Security-Policy** meta tag in the production build (GitHub Pages cannot send headers): scripts only from
  the site, network only to `script.google.com` / `script.googleusercontent.com`, images only from the site or `data:`.
- **Images** are validated on both sides (PNG/JPEG by magic bytes, ≤ 5 MB) and only ever displayed as
  `data:image/png|jpeg;base64` after an access check.
- **Pasted text from Claude and other tools is treated as data**: the essay is wrapped in markers that the student's
  text cannot fake, tool output is rendered as plain text, and Markdown feedback goes through marked + DOMPurify with a
  small tag allow-list.
- **Writes are serialized with `LockService.getScriptLock()`** (30 s wait). Read-only actions skip the lock.

## Product behaviour

- **Daily cap** counts practice/test submissions (including rewrites) in the last 24 hours. Test mode checks the cap
  when the test _starts_, so a timed essay is never refused at the end. **Assigned tests are exempt**: the teacher set
  them.
- **Timing** is computed on the server from `started_at`. "Over time" = handed in more than 2 minutes after the
  deadline. The browser corrects its countdown with the server time sent in each response.
- **Abandoned timed tests**: the hourly job submits a timed draft whose time ran out (plus grace) if it has any text,
  marked auto-submitted with time used = the limit (not "over time", since the delay was the job's). A test with no
  text stays unsubmitted; for an assignment it then shows as **missed** after the close time.
- **Assignment "missed"** is computed (no stored column): not started (or started with nothing handed in) and the
  close time has passed. The list updates at the close time without needing a job.
- **One attempt per assignment**: pressing Start again resumes the same essay with the timer still running.
- **Rewrite**: one draft rewrite per original; it inherits task type, prompt, topic and image. The student can choose
  "Start from my original text". A rewrite is late when submitted after `due_at`. Due dates are the end of the chosen
  day in the student's time zone (from their browser at sign-up, editable in Settings).
- **Overdue** is shown as soon as the due date passes (computed on read); the daily job also stores `overdue` and sends
  the overdue email once.
- **Progress highlights** need at least 4 scored essays (last 3 vs up to 3 before). Rates are errors per 100 words.
- **Top errors** per criterion use the error's category criterion; the example correction is the most recent one.
- **Claude reply parsing** accepts code fences and also extracts the outermost `{…}` if Claude adds a sentence around
  the JSON. Scores may be numbers or numeric strings. `suggested_topic` is optional; it is matched to a topic label
  ignoring case. Excerpts are matched exactly (outer whitespace trimmed); a repeated excerpt takes the next unused
  occurrence.
- **Saving the Claude draft**: a reply is stored in the Drafts tab when it passes validation ("Check reply"). On
  Submit score, the _first_ stored draft's scores become Claude's SourceFeedback row.
- **Email idempotency keys**: `<type>:<essay or request id>:<version>`. The first result email is version `1`;
  "Notify student again" uses a request ID generated by the scoring page (a double click reuses it). Reminders and
  overdue emails use the rewrite request ID with version `1`. Email content is never stored; a queued or failed email
  is rebuilt from its key, and a queued login link gets a fresh token when it is finally sent.
- **Quota**: login links need 1 send left; other emails need more than `email_quota_reserve` (default 10) left.
- **Assignment emails** are a sixth email type (`assignment_notice`), sent only when the checkbox is ticked.
- **Drive**: images uploaded with a draft are kept in a `_uploads` subfolder and moved into the essay folder on submit.
  Images shared with another essay (assignment chart, rewrite of an original) are copied, never moved or trashed.
  Renaming after a topic change keeps the folder unique with " (2)". Folder dates use the admin time zone.
- **Times** are stored in UTC ISO strings and shown in the browser's local time zone.

## Accessibility

- Every field has a label; errors are announced and the first invalid field is focused; dialogs return focus.
- Charts have a text summary (`role="img"` + `aria-label`) and a "Show data as a table" fallback.
- The error tagger works without a mouse: type the exact text instead of selecting it.
- The test timer announces 10, 5 and 1 minute left without reading every second.
